# Interactive-Album-Cover

As an introduction to the Javascript extension p5.js, I tried out this course by Zhang weidi (ART 22 course  'Computer Programming For Arts' in University of California, Santa Barbara) that introduces students to creating visuals with geometry using only code.

#### Project Link
The project can be found here: https://sayf-ismail.github.io/Interactive-Album-Cover/

#### How to run it
Using your mouse, the visual will react to movement along the horizontal x-axis.
